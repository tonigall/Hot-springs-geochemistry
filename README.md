# Hot-springs-geochemistry

This script was written to analyse the environmental variables which influence metal availability in hot spring waters. It includes a principal component analysis (PCA) and plots the outputs of this in R (v.2024.09.1+394). This is followed by multiple general linear models which were compared to determine the best statistical representation of the geochemical data and interactions between metals and environmental variables.

The dataset is being uploaded to the BGS online repository (I will add the link when it is available). 

While dissolved sulfide (S) was included in the original dataset and in general linear models, it was removed from the PCA due to a lack of literature data with S measurements.
